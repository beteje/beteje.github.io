  abstract = {In this paper, we have investigated the differences in the voices of Parkinson's disease (PD) and age-matched control (CO) subjects when uttering three phonemes using two complexity measures: fractal dimension (FD) and normalised mutual information (NMI). Three sustained phonetic voice recordings, /a/, /u/ and /m/, from 22 CO (mean age = 66.91) and 24 PD (mean age = 71.83) participants were analysed. FD was first computed for PD and CO voice recordings, followed by the computation of NMI between the test groups: PD-CO, PD-PD and CO-CO. Four features reported in the literature--normalised pitch period entropy (Norm. PPE), glottal-to-noise excitation ratio (GNE), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and glottal closing quotient (ClQ)--were also computed for comparison with the proposed complexity measures. The statistical significance of the features was tested using a one-way ANOVA test. Support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel was used to classify the test groups, using a leave-one-out validation method. The results showed that PD voice recordings had lower FD compared to CO (p < 0.008). It was also observed that the average NMI between CO voice recordings was significantly lower compared with the CO-PD and PD-PD groups (p < 0.036) for the three phonetic sounds. The average NMI and FD demonstrated higher accuracy (>80%) in differentiating the test groups compared with other speech feature-based classifications. This study has demonstrated that the voices of PD patients has reduced FD, and NMI between voice recordings of PD-CO and PD-PD is higher compared with CO-CO. This suggests that the use of NMI obtained from the sample voice, when paired with known groups of CO and PD, can be used to identify PD voices. These findings could have applications for population screening.},

  abstract = {Prosthetic hand control has fired the imagination of many researchers and thousands of papers have been published in this field, but the user acceptance has not been strong and there appears to be a significant gap between the published research and its translation. One observation of the literature is that while this requires multidisciplinary research, most articles appear to be topic focused, with lack of literature that connect across the different disciplines. This paper reports a multidisciplinary, candid review which has evaluated literature of four major associated topics: (i) User requirements, (ii) Signal recording, (iii) Signal analysis and (iv) User feedback, with the aim to identify the potential directions for research that will improve the translation of this technology. Special effort was made to collate diverse views and authors.

This review has found that more research for the analysis and evaluation of the user requirements is necessary to ensure that the amputees use these devices extensively. Further research is also required into the development of both, the paradigm and the technology to give feedback to the user from the prosthetic hand device. There is also the need to improve the electrodes and recording techniques to ensure uninterrupted user-control over extended periods of time. One important outcome of this paper is that it has uncovered the differences of performance measures used by different authors because of which it is difficult to compare the results reported in their papers.},

Group differences between the mean and variance of the gait parameters (stride interval, stance interval, swing interval and double support interval) for the three groups were calculated and statistical significance was tested.  The results showed that the variance in each of the four gait parameters of PD patients was significantly higher compared with the controls, irrespective of the three walking patterns.

Muscle fatigue in the tibialis anterior (TA) during isometric contractions at 40% and 80% maximum voluntary contraction levels was investigated in ten healthy participants (Age range: 21 to 35 years; Mean age = 26 years; Male = 4, Female = 6). HD-sEMG was used to record 64 channels of sEMG using a 16 by 4 electrode array placed over the TA. The NMI of each electrode with every other electrode was calculated to form an NMI distribution for each electrode. The total NMI for each electrode (the summation of the electrode's NMI distribution) highlighted regions of high dependence in the electrode array and was observed to increase as the muscle fatigued. To summarise this increase, a function, M(k), was defined and was found to be significantly affected by fatigue and not by contraction force. The technique discussed in this study has overcome issues regarding electrode placement and was used to investigate how the dependences between sEMG signals within the same muscle change spatially during fatigue.},

  abstract = {Directionality indices can be used as an indicator of the asymmetry in coupling between systems and have found particular application in relation to neurological systems. The directionality index between two systems is a function of measures of information transfer in both directions. Here we illustrate that before inferring the directionality of coupling it is first necessary to consider the use of appropriate tests of significance. We propose a surrogate corrected directionality index which incorporates such testing. We also highlight the differences between testing the significance of the directionality index itself versus testing the individual measures of information transfer in each direction. To validate the approach we compared two different methods of estimating coupling, both of which have previously been used to estimate directionality indices. These were the modeling-based evolution map approach and a conditional mutual information (CMI) method for calculating dynamic information rates. For the CMI-based approach we also compared two different methods for estimating the CMI, an equiquantization-based estimator and a $k$-nearest neighbors estimator.},

  abstract = {Hand movement classification based on surface electromyography (sEMG) pattern recognition is a promising approach for upper limb neuroprosthetic control. However, maintaining day-to-day performance is challenged by the non-stationary nature of sEMG in real-life operation. In this study, we propose a self-recalibrating classifier that can be automatically updated to maintain a stable performance over time without the need for user retraining. Our classifier is based on convolutional neural network (CNN) using short latency dimension-reduced sEMG spectrograms as inputs. The pretrained classifier is recalibrated routinely using a corrected version of the prediction results from recent testing sessions. Our proposed system was evaluated with the NinaPro database comprising of hand movement data of 40 intact and 11 amputee subjects. Our system was able to achieve ~10.18% (intact, 50 movement types) and ~2.99% (amputee, 10 movement types) increase in classification accuracy averaged over five testing sessions with respect to the unrecalibrated classifier. When compared with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, our CNN-based system consistently showed higher absolute performance and larger improvement as well as more efficient training. These results suggest that the proposed system can be a useful tool to facilitate long-term adoption of prosthetics for amputees in real-life applications.},

  abstract = {Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can enhance memory and cognitive functions in both rats and humans. Studies have shown that VNS influenced decision-making in epileptic patients. However, the sites of action involved in the cognitive-enhancement are poorly understood. By employing a conscious rat model equipped with vagus nerve cuff electrode, we assess the role of chronic VNS on decision-making in rat gambling task (RGT). Simultaneous multichannel-recordings offer an ideal setup to test the hypothesis that VNS may induce alterations of in both spike-field-coherence and synchronization of theta oscillations across brain areas in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). Daily VNS, administered immediately following training sessions of RGT, caused an increase in `good decision-maker' rats. Neural spikes in the ACC became synchronized with the ongoing theta oscillations of local field potential (LFP) in BLA following VNS. Moreover, cross-correlation analysis revealed synchronization between the ACC and BLA. Our results provide specific evidence that VNS facilitates decision-making and unveils several important roles for VNS in regulating LFP and spike phases, as well as enhancing spike-phase coherence between key brain areas involved in cognitive performance. These data may serve to provide fundamental notions regarding neurophysiological biomarkers for therapeutic VNS in cognitive impairment.},

  abstract = {Accurate statistical models of neural spike responses can characterize the information carried by neural populations. But the limited samples of spike counts during recording usually result in model overfitting. Besides, current models assume spike counts to be Poisson-distributed, which ignores the fact that many neurons demonstrate over-dispersed spiking behaviour. Although the Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Model (NB-GLM) provides a powerful tool for modeling over-dispersed spike counts, the maximum likelihood-based standard NB-GLM leads to highly variable and inaccurate parameter estimates. Thus, we propose a hierarchical parametric empirical Bayes method to estimate the neural spike responses among neuronal population. Our method integrates both Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and empirical Bayes theory, which aims to (1) improve the accuracy and reliability of parameter estimation, compared to the maximum likelihood-based method for NB-GLM and Poisson-GLM; (2) effectively capture the over-dispersion nature of spike counts from both simulated data and experimental data; and (3) provide insight into both neural interactions and spiking behaviours of the neuronal populations. We apply our approach to study both simulated data and experimental neural data. The estimation of simulation data indicates that the new framework can accurately predict mean spike counts simulated from different models and recover the connectivity weights among neural populations. The estimation based on retinal neurons demonstrate the proposed method outperforms both NB-GLM and Poisson-GLM in terms of the predictive log-likelihood of held-out data.},

  abstract = {Zebrafish larvae display a rapid and characteristic swimming behaviour after abrupt light onset or offset. This light-induced locomotor response (LLR) has been widely used for behavioural research and drug screening. However, the locomotor responses have long been shown to be different between different wild-type (WT) strains. Thus, it is critical to define the differences in the WT LLR to facilitate accurate interpretation of behavioural data. In this investigation, we used support vector machine (SVM) models to classify LLR data collected from three WT strains: AB, TL and TLAB (a hybrid of AB and TL), during early embryogenesis, from 3 to 9 days post-fertilisation (dpf). We analysed both the complete dataset and a subset of the data during the first 30 after light change. This initial period of activity is substantially driven by vision, and is also known as the visual motor response (VMR). The analyses have resulted in three major conclusions: First, the LLR is different between the three WT strains, and at different developmental stages. Second, the distinguishable information in the VMR is comparable to, if not better than, the full dataset for classification purposes. Third, the distinguishable information of WT strains in the light-onset response differs from that in the light-offset response. While the classification accuracies were higher for the light-offset than light-onset response when using the complete LLR dataset, a reverse trend was observed when using a shorter VMR dataset. Together, our results indicate that one should use caution when extrapolating interpretations of LLR/VMR obtained from one WT strain to another.},

  abstract = {There is considerable evidence to suggest early life experiences, such as maternal separation (MS), play a role in the prevalence of emotional dysregulation and cognitive impairment. At the same time, optimal decision making requires functional integrity between the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and any dysfunction of this system is believed to induce decision-making deficits. However, the impact of MS on decision-making behavior and the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms have not been thoroughly studied. As such, we consider the impact of MS on the emotional and cognitive functions of rats by employing the open-field test, elevated plus-maze test, and rat gambling task (RGT). Using multi-channel recordings from freely behaving rats, we assessed the effects of MS on the large scale synchrony between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the ACC; while also characterizing the relationship between neural spiking activity and the ongoing oscillations in theta frequency band across the BLA and ACC. The results indicated that the MS rats demonstrated anxiety-like behavior. While the RGT showed a decrease in the percentage of good decision-makers, and an increase in the percentage of poor decision-makers. Electrophysiological data revealed an increase in the total power in the theta band of the LFP in the BLA and a decrease in theta power in the ACC in MS rats. MS was also found to disrupt the spike-field coherence of the ACC single unit spiking activity to the ongoing theta oscillations in the BLA and interrupt the synchrony in the BLA-ACC pathway. We provide specific evidence that MS leads to decision-making deficits that are accompanied by alteration of the theta band LFP in the BLA-ACC circuitries and disruption of the neural network integrity. These observations may help revise fundamental notions regarding neurophysiological biomarkers to treat cognitive impairment induced by early life stress.},

  abstract = {The rodent anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is critical for visceral pain and pain-related aversive response in chronic visceral hypersensitive (VH) state. Long-term potentiation (LTP), induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) in the medial thalamus (MT)-ACC pathway, is blocked in VH rats. However, the neuronal intrinsic firing characteristics and the MT-ACC connectivity have not been investigated in visceral pain.



Using repetitive distension of the colon and rectum (rCRD) as a sensitization paradigm, we have identified that the spontaneous firing rates of ACC neurons and the CRD-stimulated neuronal firings were increased after repetitive visceral noxious stimulation. This correlates with increases in visceral pain responses (visceromotor responses, VMRs).

Two multichannel arrays of electrodes were implanted in the MT and ACC. Recordings were performed in free-moving rats before and after repeated CRD treatment. Power spectral density analysis showed that the local field potential (LFP) recorded in the ACC displayed increases in theta band power (4-10 Hz) that were modulated by rCRD. Neural spike activity in the ACC becomes synchronized with ongoing theta oscillations of LFP. Furthermore, cross correlation analysis showed augmented synchronization of thalamo-ACC theta band LFPs, which was consistent with an increase of neuronal communication between the two regions.

In conclusion, these results reveal theta oscillations and theta-frequency phase-locking as prominent features of neural activity in the ACC and a candidate neural mechanism underlying acute visceral pain.},

  abstract = {Background
Patients following prolonged cancer chemotherapy are at high risk of emotional and cognitive deficits. Research indicates that the brain neuronal temporal coding and synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) are critical in memory and perception. We studied the effects of cisplatin on induction of LTP in the basolateral amygdala (BLA)-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) pathway, characterized the coordination of spike timing with local theta oscillation, and identified synchrony in the BLA-ACC network integrity.

Results
In the study presented, the impacts of cisplatin on emotional and cognitive functions were investigated by elevated plus-maze test, Morris water maze test, and rat Iowa gambling task (RGT). Electrophysiological recordings were conducted to study long-term potentiation. Simultaneous recordings from multi-electrodes were performed to characterize the neural spike firing and ongoing theta oscillation of local field potential (LFP), and to clarify the synchronization of large scale of theta oscillation in the BLA-ACC pathway. Cisplatin-treated rats demonstrated anxiety- like behavior, exhibited impaired spatial reference memory. RGT showed decrease of the percentage of good decision-makers, and increase in the percentage of maladaptive behavior (delay-good decision-makers plus poor decision-makers). Cisplatin suppressed the LTP, and disrupted the phase-locking of ACC single neural firings to the ongoing theta oscillation; further, cisplatin interrupted the synchrony in the BLA-ACC pathway.

Conclusions
We provide the first direct evidence that the cisplatin interrupts theta-frequency phase-locking of ACC neurons. The block of LTP and disruption of synchronized theta oscillations in the BLA-ACC pathway are associated with emotional and cognitive deficits in rats, following cancer chemotherapy.},

These approaches also have considerable potential for clinical use ``at the bedside''. However, a highly nontrivial task and precondition if such methods are to be used routinely is the robust physiological interpretation of the data. In this paper, we explore the ability of a previously developed model of brain circulation and metabolism to explain and predict quantitatively the responses of physiological signals. The five signals all noninvasively-measured during hypoxemia in healthy volunteers include four signals measured using near-infrared spectroscopy along with middle cerebral artery blood flow measured using transcranial Doppler flowmetry. We show that optimising the model using partial data from an individual can increase its predictive power thus aiding the interpretation of NIRS signals in individuals. At the same time such optimisation can also help refine model parametrisation and provide confidence intervals on model parameters. Discrepancies between model and data which persist despite model optimisation are used to flag up important questions concerning the underlying physiology, and the reliability and physiological meaning of the signals.},

The hypothesis of this study was that within group NMI will be significantly different when compared with inter- group NMI.

Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to determine the association of NMI with clinical parameters including Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and disease duration.

  abstract  = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) has the potential to provide valuable information regarding the status and health of a muscle. In particular, recent developments in high density sEMG (HD-sEMG), which allow simultaneous recordings from a greater number of electrodes, enable the calculation of muscle attributes such as the conduction velocity of motor unit action potentials. However, as with standard recording montages, HD-sEMG requires careful placement of the electrodes to align with the direction of the muscle fibres, thus limiting practical applications. In this paper we demonstrate an algorithm for calculating muscle fibre conduction velocity which is independent of the alignment of the array. The algorithm automatically corrects for the misalignment of the array whilst estimating the conduction velocity using common local all-pass (CLAP) filters. Specifically, the misalignment is modelled as a rotation of the array relative to the fibre and this rotation is estimated by iteratively fitting the model to the output of the CLAP filters. We validate the proposed algorithm on simulated HD-sEMG data generated from a realistic biological model, demonstrating that the algorithm obtains an accurate estimate of the conduction velocity even when the array is misaligned.},

In this paper we present a method for TVD estimation which is suitable for real-time non-stationary applications. The proposed method combines local all-pass (LAP) filters with a Kalman filter. By using measurement fusion to combine the outputs of several LAP filters in the Kalman filter we can accurately track TVDs whilst allowing for fast and efficient parallel computation.

The HD-sEMG recordings used in this study were taken from three participants who performed two isometric contractions of their biceps at 40% and 80% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force. White Gaussian noisy was added to a varying number of recorded signals before being digital filtering to generate a variety of recordings to test the technique with. In the recordings, groups of 2, 4, 8, and 16 electrodes had noise added such that the signal to noise ratios (SNR) were 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20dB. The results show that the technique can reliably identify groups of 2, 4, and 8 noisy electrodes with SNRs of 0, 5, and 10dB.},

Since, these outliers lie within the frequency range of electromyographic activity (30-300 Hz), conventional filtering methods fail to remove them. Hence, an application of an outlier filtering technique, Hampel filtering, has been introduced which is proficient at removing high frequency impulsive spikes (100-150 Hz) from facial sEMG. The Hampel filter removes the outliers without distorting the original data sequence and improves the quality of the signal as observed in time-frequency analysis.},

Using mutual information based feature selection we found that a subset of not more than 10 sEMG features selected from over seven thousand, could effectively classify object weights in grasp-and-lift tasks. Average classification accuracies of 82.53% in the acceleration phase and 88.61% in the isometric contraction phase were achieved. Furthermore, sEMG features associated with object weights and common across individuals were identified. These time-domain features (entropy, mean/median absolute deviation, pNNx) can be calculated efficiently, providing possible new indicators.},

Methods which focus on the variance of the data make it possible to overlook these small components in the synergy extraction process. However, algorithms which address the inherent complexity in the neuromuscular system are lacking. To that end we propose a new nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm which employs a cross fuzzy entropy similarity measure, thus, extracting muscle synergies which preserve the complexity of the recorded muscular data.

Simulations in a sparse environment show the proposed class of algorithms offer enhanced performance and increased stability over the standard PNLMS.},

The Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirths and Deaths in Infancy reported a mortality rate of 0.62 per 1000 births in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 1999. In this work we compare the heart rate information that can be derived from the Doppler audio signal with that derived from the ECG from a scalp electrode, on a beat-to-beat basis. Challenges associated with using the Doppler audio signal include elimination of the noise arising from the movement of the foetal heart and valves and correct peak blood velocity identification. From this beat-to-beat analysis, we can explore the use of a quantitative measure of heart rate variability for the detection of foetal distress. Previously it has been found, in rats, that this measure of heart rate variability increases considerably when asphyxia occurs. Data has been collected from five mothers in the first stage of labour. Currently, the comparison of heart rate signals from the Doppler audio and ECG signals shows an excellent agreement on a beat-to-beat basis (rms error of less than 10 ms). In this pilot study the fetal heart rate
variability has remained at a relatively constant low level, which is expected, as only `normal' labours have been studied so far. Our results are very encouraging and show that there is potential for the use of this method of intrapartum monitoring and the technique could also be applied at antepartum, but this is a pilot study and many more results are needed before firm conclusions and recommendations can be made.},

Hence, in this paper we develop an approach for determining 3D cellular alignment based on image gradients and directional statistics. The intensity gradients of the volumetric image are used to construct a 3D vector field and the local dominant orientations of this vector field then determined.},

  abstract = {The focus of this paper is the estimation of a delay between two signals. Such a problem is common in signal processing and particularly challenging when the delay is non-stationary in nature. Our proposed solution is based on an all-pass filter framework comprising of two elements: a time delay is equivalent to all-pass filtering and an all-pass filter can be represented in terms of a ratio of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter and its time reversal. Using these elements, we propose an adaptive filtering algorithm with an LMS style update that estimates the FIR filter coefficients and the time delay. Specifically, at each time step, the algorithm updates the filter coefficients based on a gradient descent update and then extracts an estimate of the time delay from the filter. We validate our algorithm on synthetic data demonstrating that it is both accurate and capable of tracking time-varying delays.},

  abstract = {Objective. Lesions of COVID-19 can be clearly visualized using chest CT images, and hence provide valuable evidence for clinicians when making a diagnosis. However, due to the variety of COVID-19 lesions and the complexity of the manual delineation procedure, automatic analysis of lesions with unknown and diverse types from a CT image remains a challenging task. In this paper we propose a weakly-supervised framework for this task requiring only a series of normal and abnormal CT images without the need for annotations of the specific locations and types of lesions. Approach. A deep learning-based diagnosis branch is employed for classification of the CT image and then a lesion identification branch is leveraged to capture multiple types of lesions. Main Results. Our framework is verified on publicly available datasets and CT data collected from 13 patients of the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, China. The results show that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art diagnosis prediction, and the extracted lesion features are capable of distinguishing between lesions showing ground glass opacity and consolidation. Significance. The proposed approach integrates COVID-19 positive diagnosis and lesion analysis into a unified framework without extra pixel-wise supervision. Further exploration also demonstrates that this framework has the potential to discover lesion types that have not been reported and can potentially be generalized to lesion detection of other chest-based diseases.},

Landmark management is necessary in order to maintain a consistent map of the estimated landmarks relative to the estimate of the platform's pose. This task is particularly important when faced with multiple detections from the same landmark and/or dynamic environments where the location of a landmark can change. A further challenge with radar data is the presence of false detections. Accordingly, we propose a simple yet efficient rule based solution for radar SLAM landmark management. Assuming a low-dynamic environment, there are several steps in our solution: new landmarks need to be detected and included, false landmarks need to be identified and removed, and the consistency of the landmarks registered in the map needs to be maintained. To illustrate our solution, we run an extended Kalman filter SLAM algorithm in an environment containing both stationary and temporally stationary landmarks. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution is capable of reliably managing landmarks even when faced with false detections and multiple detections from the same landmark.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that aging disturbs healthy brain organization and functional connectivity. However, how this age-induced alteration impacts dynamic brain function interaction has not yet been fully investigated. Dynamic function network connectivity (DFNC) analysis can produce a brain representation based on the time-varying network connectivity changes, which can be further used to study the brain aging mechanism for people at different age stages.

Method: This presented investigation examined the dynamic functional connectivity representation and its relationship with brain age for people at an elderly stage as well as in early adulthood. Specifically, the resting-state fMRI data from the University of North Carolina cohort of 34 young adults and 28 elderly participants were fed into a DFNC analysis pipeline. This DFNC pipeline forms an integrated dynamic functional connectivity (FC) analysis framework, which consists of brain functional network parcellation, dynamic FC feature extraction, and FC dynamics examination.

Results: The statistical analysis demonstrates that extensive dynamic connection changes in the elderly concerning the transient brain state and the method of functional interaction in the brain. In addition, various machine learning algorithms have been developed to verify the ability of dynamic FC features to distinguish the age stage. The fraction time of DFNC states has the highest performance, which can achieve a classification accuracy of over 88% by a decision tree.

Discussion: The results proved there are dynamic FC alterations in the elderly, and the alteration was found to be correlated with mnemonic discrimination ability and could have an impact on the balance of functional integration and segregation.},

In SLAM applications, with a greater requirement for the environment map, information on the extent of landmarks is vital for precise navigation and path planning. Although object extent estimation has been successfully applied in target tracking, its adaption to SLAM remains unaddressed due to the additional uncertainty of the sensor platform, bias in the odometer reading, as well as the measurement non-linearity. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the Bayesian random matrix approach to estimate the extent of landmarks in radar SLAM. We describe the details for implementation of landmark extent initialization, prediction and update. To validate the performance of our proposed approach we compare with the model-free ellipse fitting algorithm with results showing more consistent extent estimation. We also demonstrate that exploiting the landmark extent in the state update can improve localization accuracy.},

Specifically, a brief overview of the SFC and DFC methods for fMRI analysis is provided, along with the preprocessing and denoising procedures that go into these methods. Following that, the current status of research in functional connectivity networks for post-stoke patients under these two views was synthesized individually. Results show that SFC is the most frequent post-stroke functional connectivity analysis method. The SFC findings demonstrate that the stroke lesion reduces FC between motor areas, and the FC increase positively correlates with functional recovery. Meanwhile, the current DFC analysis in post-stroke has just been uncovered as the tip of the iceberg of its prospect, and its exceptionally rapidly progressing development can be expected.},

  number   = {66},
  volume   = {22},
  abstract = {Background:

Motor impairment is a common consequence of stroke causing difficulty in independent movement. The first month of post-stroke rehabilitation is the most effective period for recovery. Movement imagination, known as motor imagery, in combination with virtual reality may provide a way for stroke patients with severe motor disabilities to begin rehabilitation.

Methods:

The aim of this study is to verify whether motor imagery and virtual reality help to activate stroke patients’ motor cortex. 16 acute/subacute (< 6 months) stroke patients participated in this study. All participants performed motor imagery of basketball shooting which involved the following tasks: listening to audio instruction only, watching a basketball shooting animation in 3D with audio, and also performing motor imagery afterwards. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded for analysis of motor-related features of the brain such as power spectral analysis in the α and β frequency bands and spectral entropy. 18 EEG channels over the motor cortex were used for all stroke patients.

Results:

All results are normalised relative to all tasks for each participant. The power spectral densities peak near the α band for all participants and also the β band for some participants. Tasks with instructions during motor imagery generally show greater power spectral peaks. The p-values of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for band power comparison from the 18 EEG channels between different pairs of tasks show a 0.01 significance of rejecting the band powers being the same for most tasks done by stroke subjects. The motor cortex of most stroke patients is more active when virtual reality is involved during motor imagery as indicated by their respective scalp maps of band power and spectral entropy.

Conclusion:

The resulting activation of stroke patient’s motor cortices in this study reveals evidence that it is induced by imagination of movement and virtual reality supports motor imagery. The framework of the current study also provides an efficient way to investigate motor imagery and virtual reality during post-stroke rehabilitation.},

  title        = {Dynamic Reconfiguration of Brain Functional Network in Stroke},
  abstract     = {The brain continually reorganizes its functional network to adapt to post-stroke functional impairments. Previous studies using static modularity analysis have presented global-level behavior patterns of this network reorganization. However, it is far from understood how the brain reconfigures its functional network dynamically following a stroke. This study collected resting-state functional MRI data from 15 stroke patients, with mild (n = 6) and severe (n = 9) two subgroups based on their clinical symptoms. Additionally, 15 age-matched healthy subjects were considered as controls. By applying a multilayer network method, a dynamic modular structure was recognized based on a time-resolved function network. Then dynamic network measurements (recruitment, integration, and flexibility) were calculated to characterize the dynamic reconfiguration of post-stroke brain functional networks, hence, to reveal the neural functional rebuilding process. It was found from this investigation that severe patients tended to have reduced recruitment and increased between-network integration, while mild patients exhibited low network flexibility and less network integration. It is also noted that this severity-dependent alteration in network interaction was not able to be revealed by previous studies using static methods. Clinically, the obtained knowledge of the diverse patterns of dynamic adjustment in brain functional networks observed from the brain signal could help understand the underlying mechanism of the motor, speech, and cognitive functional impairments caused by stroke attacks. The proposed method not only could be used to evaluate patients' current brain status but also has the potential to provide insights into prognosis analysis and prediction.},
