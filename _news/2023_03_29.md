Our new paper on tracking functional network connectivity dynamics in the elderly has just been published in Frontiers in Neuroscience ([doi:10.3389/fnins.2023.1146264](http://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2023.1146264){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}).

This work sets up the framework for tracking dynamic functional connectivity and gives us an understanding of what the aging process looks like in terms of functional connectivity. As the next phase in this work we are now investigating how this compares with changes observed in the dynamic functional connectivity of stroke patients. More details on current functional connectivity work can be found here: [Tracking Functional Connectivity](../../research/functionalconnectivity/).

The paper is available here: [Tracking Functional Network Connectivity Dynamics in the Elderly](../../assets/pdf/2023_Frontiers.pdf) and the code is available here: [Tracking Functional Network Connectivity Dynamics in the Elderly Repository](https://github.com/xiaohajiayouo/Tracking_Functional_Network_Connectivity_Dynamics_in_the_Elderly){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
