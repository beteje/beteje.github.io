We have just published a new paper in <i>Sensors</i> on Cooperative Localization Using Distance Measurements for Mobile Nodes.

The proposed algorithm uses the movement of the nodes to localize the nodes using inter-node distance measures without ambiguity. This method allows localization in GNSS denied environments and will form part of our work with high altitude balloons.
