We have just published a new paper in <i>Sensors</i> on Cooperative Localization Using Distance Measurements for Mobile Nodes.

The proposed algorithm uses the movement of the nodes to localize the nodes using inter-node distance measures without ambiguity. This method allows localization in GNSS denied environments and will form part of our work with high altitude balloons.

The paper is available here: [Cooperative Localization Paper](../../assets/pdf/2021_Sensors.pdf) and here: [doi:10.3390/s21041507](http://doi.org/10.3390/s21041507){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
