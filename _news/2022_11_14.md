I have just returned from the Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing (APSIPA) Annual Summit and Conference (ASC) in Thailand. As always this was a great conference with always that little something extra -- this time the organizers arranged for us to go down to the river to take part in the Loy Krathong (lantern) festival which was occurring at the same time as the conference.

The conference gave us a first opportunity to present our [radar SLAM](../../research/radarslam/) work. Unfortunately Shuai couldn't join us but it was still a good chance to share some of what we have been working on with the community.

While there we also had the Biomedical Signal Processing and Systems Technical Committee meeting. I am extremely honoured to have been elected as the technical committee chair and hope to be able to do my best to help promote all the great work that is being done in the Asia-Pacific region on this topic. We aim to hold a workshop next year so if anyone has any suggestions/comments I would welcome the feedback.
