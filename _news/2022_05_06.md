I'm happy to announce that I have relocated to the University of Birmingham where I will be working as an Assistant Professor in the School of Engineering.

I am also recruiting PhD students who are interested in signal/image processing for a variety of different applications, you will be joining an international group with students also based in Melbourne, Australia and Shantou, China. There may also be the opportunity for joint PhD projects with the University of Melbourne.
