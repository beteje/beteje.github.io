We are currently looking for a candidate to work on a project developing models and algorithms to allow high altitude balloons to autonomously organise themselves. We are particularly interested in developing techniques which allow the balloons to configure themselves according to the mission requirements and the information to be collected.

More details on the project can be found here: [PhD Scholarship in Cooperative Localisation for Constellations of High Altitude Balloon Platforms](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/information-for/research-candidates/enriching-your-candidature/grants-and-scholarships/2019/postgraduate-by-research/phd-scholarship-in-cooperative-localisation-for-constellations-o).
