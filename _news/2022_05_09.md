We will be presenting our IEEE Signal Processing Letter on time-varying delay estimation using an adaptive all-pass filter at this years [ICASSP](https://2022.ieeeicassp.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Unfortunately I won't be making it to Singapore but we will be at the virtual conference, our gather.town session is on Friday afternoon (13th May).

The paper can be found here: [Adaptive All-Pass Filter Paper](../../assets/pdf/2020_AAP.pdf) and more details of our research on delay estimation using all-pass filters can be found here: [delay estimation](../../research/delayestimation/).
