As a nice end to the year our paper on the analysis of lesions using CT scans has been published in <i>Physics in Medicine & Biology</i>.

This is the first output from Kaichao's PhD, which is being completed jointly with Shantou University. So making the most of the fact that he couldn't come to Australia to start his PhD he has been looking at CT images of COVID-19 patients and how we can used weakly supervised learning to identify different types of lesions without the need for detailed annotations.

The paper is available here: [Weakly Supervised Lesion Analysis for COVID-19 Paper](../../assets/pdf/2021_PMB.pdf) and the journal link is here: [doi:10.1088/1361-6560/ac4316](http://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ac4316){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and the code is available here: [Weakly Supervised Lesion Analysis for COVID-19 Repository](https://github.com/xiaohajiayouo/Weakly-supervisied-lesion-analysis-for-COVID-19){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
