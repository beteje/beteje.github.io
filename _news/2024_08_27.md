Our latest work looking at functional connectivity of cochlear implant users will be presented by Jamal Esmaelpoor at the fNIRS conference to be held at the University of Birmingham ([fNIRS 2024](https://fnirs2024.fnirs.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) and a preprint of the upcoming paper is available here: [doi:10.1101/2024.08.22.24312200](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.22.24312200){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

The outcome of the first study on the relationship between resting-state functional connectivity and speech outcomes has recently been published in Ear & Hearing ([doi:10.1097/AUD.0000000000001564](https://doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000001564){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) and this new work extends the concept of using functional connectivity to understand outcomes in cochlear implant users by developing a robust approach for assessing task-induced cross-modal functional connectivity.

Copies of both papers are available here: [Resting-state Functional Connectivity Predicts Cochlear-Implant Speech Outcomes](../../assets/pdf/2024_Ear_Hearing.pdf), [Cross-modal Functional Plasticity after Cochlear-implantation](../../assets/pdf/2024_Esmaelpoor.pdf).
