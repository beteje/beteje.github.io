We have an opening for a research fellow in sensor signal processing. This is a 1 year post to develop signal processing algorithms for path planning and scheduling of multiple mobile sensing platforms.

The research fellow will be based in the [Microwave Integrated Systems Lab (MISL)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/misl){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at the University of Birmingham and will work closely with our collaborator in Australia. We are looking for someone with a strong background in signal processing who is interested in helping us develop a practical solution for long-term planning of a group of autonomous sensing platforms.

If you would like more information please get in touch. Full details of how to apply can be found here: [Research Fellow in Sensor Signal Processing](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/DJB512/research-fellow-sensor-signal-processing){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
