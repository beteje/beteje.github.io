We have an opportunity for a joint PhD between the University of Birmingham and the University of Melbourne. The project will focus on cooperative sensing with radar for UAV networks and will be working with Chris Gilliam and myself at University of Birmingham and Airlie Chapman and Eric Schoof at University of Melbourne.

There are 2 scholarships available, one based at University of Birmingham and one based at University of Melbourne. Each student will also get to spend 1 year at the other university.

The candidate based at the University of Birmingham will focus on  developing a robust signal processing framework for topographic reconstruction from a network of radar enabled UAVs. Details of the project and how to apply can be found here:
