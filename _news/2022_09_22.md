We have just published the first output of a new project on SLAM using radar measurements.

This work is a collaboration with the [RF and Antennas Research Group](rfant.org.au){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at RMIT University and Dalian Maritime University to investigate the use of RoSAR for SLAM.

This first publication covers landmark management in SLAM when using radar measurements, we have used an EKF SLAM framework but the landmark management should work equally well with other SLAM solutions. More details on the project can be found here: [radar SLAM](../../research/radarslam/) and there is a copy of the paper here: [landmark management paper](../../assets/pdf/2022_Sun.pdf).
