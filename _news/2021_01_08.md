We have just released a preprint of our latest work on time-varying delay estimation on the arXiv.  This work uses the same all-pass filter principle as our previous [delay estimation work](../../research/delayestimation/) but implements an adaptive filter to estimate the filter coefficients eliminating the need to have all of the data in advance.
