We have just released a preprint of our latest work on time-varying delay estimation on the arXiv.  This work uses the same all-pass filter principle as our previous [delay estimation work](../../research/delayestimation/) but implements an adaptive filter to estimate the filter coefficients eliminating the need to have all of the data in advance.

The paper is available here: [Adaptive All-Pass Filter Paper](../../assets/pdf/2020_AAP.pdf) and on [arXiv:2101.02406](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02406){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, code to implement the filter is available on GitHub: [LAP Delay Estimation Repository](https://github.com/beteje/LAP_DelayEstimation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

**Update March 19, 2021:** This paper has now been published in IEEE Signal Processing Letters [doi:10.1109/LSP.2021.3065889](https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3065889){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
