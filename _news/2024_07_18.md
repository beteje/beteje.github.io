Myself and my colleague Fatemeh Norouzian are currently have an opening for a full funded PhD on full-situational awareness to enhance transportation safety.

The PhD project will focus on the development of theoretical modelling of cutting-edge short-range sensing technology; verification of the modelling with experimental data from commercially available THz sensors; and the design of automatic detection and classification capabilities for complex environments.

The candidate will join the [Microwave Integrated Systems Lab (MISL)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/misl){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at the University of Birmingham which is a multidisciplinary collaborative team and the largest academic research team in the UK working on radar, remote sensing and signal processing.
