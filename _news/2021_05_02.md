Very happy to announce that after a bit of a delay due to various team members changing jobs/graduating our paper on spike train models using empirical Bayes has just been published in <i>IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</i>.

This paper relates to work performed at the Laboratory for Computational Neuroscience at CityU HK on statistical models for neural spiking which account for over-dispersed spiking behaviour and with only limited numbers of samples.
