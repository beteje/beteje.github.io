RMIT University and Shantou University are currently offering scholarships for joint PhD projects in biomedical engineering. In the medical signal processing area, the projects will support current work in topics such as image processing and machine learning for cell and tissue imaging; or investigation of neural dynamics and connectivity. This is a great collaborative opportunity with the candidates spending time at both the RMIT campuses in Melbourne and the STU campus in Shantou.
