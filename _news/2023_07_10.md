We have two new papers out on our stroke rehabilitation work. First Rob (Chi Sang) has published a paper looking at the use of virtual reality in stroke rehabilitation ([doi:10.1186/s12938-023-01124-9](http://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-023-01124-9){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}). Our aim is to investigate whether virtual reality can be used to aid motor imagery and therefore be used as an early intervention in stroke rehabilitation.  

The second paper is the follow up to Kaichao's paper on tracking functional network connectivity in the elderly ([arXiv:2306.15209](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15209){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}). In this paper we are looking at differences in the reconfiguration of the functional connectivity after stroke and particularly how these change depending on the severity of the stroke.

Both papers are available here: [Virtual Reality and Motor Imagery for Early Post-Stroke Rehabilitation](../../assets/pdf/2023_BioMed.pdf), [Dynamic Reconfiguration of Brain Functional Network in Stroke](../../assets/pdf/2024_JBHI.pdf).

### EMBC

    I am also happy to say I will be at <a href="https://embc.embs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMBC</a>  in Sydney at the end of the month where we have 2 more papers relating to functional connectivity. Kaichao will be presenting work related to changes in modularity in the brain functional network after stroke and Jamal will be presenting some interesting results related to functional connectivity in block design experiments and the differences between control trials and baseline. More details on our functional connectivity work can be found here: <a href="../../research/functionalconnectivity/">Tracking Functional Connectivity</a>.
