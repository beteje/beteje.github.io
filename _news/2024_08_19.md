:tada: Congratulations to Kaichao Wu on completing his PhD! :tada:

Kaichao is the first graduate of joint program between RMIT University and Shantou University. Kaichao's PhD has investigated functional connectivity in post-stroke patients. Despite starting his PhD during the COVID-19 pandemic and being unable to travel to Australia, Kaichao managed to use this time to produce a framework for weakly-supervised lung segmentation from CT images [Weakly Supervised Lesion Analysis for COVID-19](../../assets/pdf/2021_PMB.pdf) and has since produced a longitudinal study of functional connectivity in stroke patients more details are available here: [functional connectivity](../../research/functionalconnectivity/).

The latest work from Kaichao's PhD, a review of functional connectivity post-stroke, has just been published in IEEE Access ([doi:10.1186/s12938-023-01124-9](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-023-01124-9){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) and the outcomes of the longitudinal study are available as a preprint ([arXiv:2401.08607](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08607){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"})

Copies of both papers are available here: [fMRI-based Static and Dynamic Functional Connectivity Analysis for Post-stroke Motor Dysfunction Patient: A Review](../../assets/pdf/2024_Access.pdf), [Dynamic Brain Behaviours in Stroke: A Longitudinal Investigation BAsed on fMRI Analysis](../../assets/pdf/2024_Wu.pdf).
