We are currently looking for a candidate to work on a project developing signal processing techniques for neural connectivity using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The project is in collaboration with the Bionics Institute with the goal of investigating changes in connectivity between multisensory language areas of the cortex following cochlear implant.

More details on the project can be found here: [Bionics Institute -- RMIT University PhD Research Scholarship Program Project 2](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/information-for/research-candidates/enriching-your-candidature/grants-and-scholarships/2019/postgraduate-by-research/bionics-institute---rmit-university-phd-research-scholarship-pro0).
