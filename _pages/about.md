I am an Assistant Professor in Signal Processing and Data Analysis in the [Microwave Integrated Systems Lab (MISL)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/misl){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} based in the School of Engineering at the University of Birmingham, UK.

My research interests are in adaptive signal processing especially statistical signal processing and signal characterisation. In particular, I am interested in the intersection of signal processing and machine learning and how signal processing techniques can be used to inform machine learning algorithms. I also have a specific interest in how these techniques can be applied to multichannel and multimodal data, particularly with reference to biomedical and neural applications.

I am always keen to hear from potential PhD students who have an interest in signal and image processing particularly for time-varying problems.
