I am Vice Chancellor's Research Fellow in the School of Engineering at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia.

My research interests are in statistical signal processing and machine learning. Focusing on adaptive approaches to signal modality characterisation, multichannel and multimodal signal processing and blind source separation/extraction. In particular I am interested in the application of such techniques to biomedical research.
