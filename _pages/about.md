I am Vice Chancellor's Research Fellow in the School of Engineering at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia.

My research interests are in adaptive signal processing especially statistical signal processing and signal characterisation. In particular, I am interested in the intersection of signal processing and machine learning and how signal processing techniques can be used to inform machine learning algorithms. I also have a specific interest in how these techniques can be applied to multichannel and multimodal data, particularly with reference to biomedical and neural applications.
