### Summary:
I am currently a recipient of a Vice Chancellor's Research Fellowship at RMIT University where I work in the School of Engineering. Before this I worked as a Research Fellow at City University of Hong Kong. Where I worked in the [Laboratory for Computational Neuroscience](https://cityucompuneurolab.github.io/){:target="_blank"} with my research focusing on hierarchical models of finger coordination.

I have also had the opportunity to apply my research in a number of different areas. Prior to moving to Hong Kong I was a member of the [Near Infrared Spectroscopy Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-physics-biomedical-engineering/nirs){:target="_blank"} at the Biomedical Optics Research Lab in the Department of Medical Physics & Bioengineering at University College London, where I worked on a Wellcome Trust funded project entitled "Integrating monitoring & modelling for real time tracking of cerebral circulation and metabolism." While at UCL I was involved with several different outreach events and also acted as an event manager for the inaugral [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.com/){:target="_blank"} festival.

Extending beyond biomedical applications, I have also worked in the [Bayley Lab](http://bayley.chem.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} in the Chemistry Department at the University of Oxford jointly with the [Systems & Signals Group](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nsjones/){:target="_blank"} in the Physics Department (now at Imperial Mathematics Department) investigating statistical signal processing techniques to aid the use of nanopore technology for DNA sequencing. While at Oxford I was on the organising committee of "[enGENEious](http://engeneious.chem.ox.ac.uk/index.htm){:target="_blank"}" a conference on microbial engineering.

My PhD research was in statistical analysis of signal processing methods for machine learning application. In particular for the assessment of changes in the nature of processed signals. In this case the processed signals ranged from EEG data to wind recordings. I completed my PhD at Imperial College London with [Prof. Danilo Mandic](http://www.commsp.ee.ic.ac.uk/~mandic/){:target="_blank"} in the Communications and Signal Processing Group in the Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering.
